Anti-money laundering (AML) refers to the activities financial institutions perform to achieve compliance with legal requirements to actively monitor for and report suspicious activities.

Money laundering is a crime that conceals the origins of illegally obtained funds, making them appear legitimate. It involves three distinct stages: placement, layering, and integration. 
Common techniques include cash smuggling, shell companies, and real estate investments.
